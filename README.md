Animate objects with lots of parts in Maya

If using 3DS Max, it is possible to use this in conjunction with the "Send To" option.<br>
If Max has different units than cm, you may need to scale the scene in Maya for it to pass correctly back into Max. To do so, just select everything, group, scale the group, and ungroup. All materials remain intact as long as you only send back the animated objects.
